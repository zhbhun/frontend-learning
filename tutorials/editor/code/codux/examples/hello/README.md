# Codux Intro Tutorial

This interactive tutorial project was designed to get you started with Codux, the Visual IDE for React Projects, an all in one visual development environment. Each component within the project contains a fun lesson that teaches the basic concepts of Codux.

The project includes SCSS support for writing nested rules, style variables, imports, and more. Feel free to clone the project and take Codux for a test drive.
