For sleek and sophisticated animations that run smoothly, GSAP is ideal. You can animate anything, from DOM elements to SVGs, and its ecosystem includes some amazing plugins that let you do all sorts of fun stuff, e.g., morphing SVGs, drawing SVG strokes, scrolling functionality, scrambling text, and much more. It’s fast, cross-browser compatible, and its syntax is straightforward and intuitive.
- [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/) - AnimeJS is the newest addition to our list, but has won a great many converts since its creation. It’s incredibly versatile and powerful and wouldn’t be out of place powering HTML game animations. The only real question is “is it overkill for simple web apps?”

It has many different animations, many of which are quite unique to this library. As with Animate.css, you can implement Magic by simply importing the CSS file. You can also implement the animations using jQuery. This project offers a particularly cool demo application.

- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) - Hover.css is a CSS animation library designed for use with buttons and other UI elements in your website. It has really nice 2D transitions, along with a host of other well-crafted animations.
