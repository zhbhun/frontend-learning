## Effect

- [filterous-2](https://github.com/girliemac/filterous-2) - Instagram-like photo manipulation library for Node.js and Javascript on browser
- [Lena.js](https://github.com/davidsonfellipe/lena.js) - Library for image processing

  Lena.js can be described as a very simple, yet nice and neat image redactor and processor. It has a number (22 to be precise) image filters that you can play around with to improve your image. Lena.js is very small in size and has a killer feature that allows you to add your own filters, as it’s code is open to anyone at GitHub.

- [ImageFlow](https://github.com/one-piece-official/ImageFlow) - Node Image Effect Component By OpenGl ES
- [marvinj](https://github.com/gabrielarchanjo/marvinj) - Javascript Image Processing Framework based on Marvin Framework
- [blurify](https://github.com/dabanlee/blurify)

  This JavaScript image manipulation library is tiny, as it weighs less than 2 kb. But it’s effectiveness doesn’t allow us to not include it on the list, as it downgrades the pictures that you provide it with, and does it gracefully.

## Resize

- [pica](https://github.com/nodeca/pica)

  Pica is a prime tool for in-browser image resizing, most useful when you want to reduce an exceedingly large image into a suitable one in order to save upload time. It avoids the pixelation of an image and works at a suitably fast pace. It serves a great amount of server resources on image processing and can reuse your images into thumbnails in the browser. What’s also great about Pica is the fact that it auto selects such technologies as web workers, webassembly, createImageBitmap, pure JS, etc. automatically, so there is no need for you to do it yourself.

## merge

- [merge-images](https://github.com/lukechilds/merge-images)

  A unique entree of this list, as Merge Images doesn’t crop or skew or rotate the images. We hope, you’ve already guessed what this one does – it merges the given images onto one canvas, ridding you of the need to transform them into code and working on a canvas (pun intended).

## Utils
