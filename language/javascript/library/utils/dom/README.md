- https://github.com/franciscop/umbrella - Lightweight javascript library for DOM manipulation and events
- [Dom7](https://framework7.io/docs/dom7) - Framework7 doesn't use any third party library, even for DOM manipulation. It has its own custom DOM7 - DOM library that utilizes most edge and high-performance methods for DOM manipulation. You donâ€™t need to learn something new, its usage is very simple because it has the same syntax as well known jQuery library with support of the most popular and widely used methods and jQuery-like chaining.
