# 框架

- [nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) - Nuxt is a higher-level framework built on top of the Vue ecosystem which provides a streamlined development experience for writing universal Vue applications. Better yet, you can also use it as a static site generator!
- [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) - Quasar is a complete Vue-based solution that allows you to target SPA, SSR, PWA, mobile app, desktop app, and browser extension all using one codebase. It not only handles the build setup, but also provides a full collection of Material Design compliant UI components.
- [Vite SSR](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html) / https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/playground/ssr-vue
